# Team Profile Generator

A command line application that generates an HTML page for all of your team members.

## Installation

Open in your terminal of choice, type "npm i" to install all necessary packages, then type "node index.js" in the terminal to start the application. When you're finished, your generated HTML page will be available in the 'dist' directory.
